## This repository contains all challenges I have completed and submitted on SoloLearn.

### Below are challenges name:

## Spaces-from-String:
In this challenge, user can remove space between a sentence.

## Sort-a-String:
In this challenge, user can sort a string alphabetically and it also cater alphanumeric characters.

## Roman-Number-Converter:
In this challenge, user can enter decimal number which will convert to its respective Roman number.

## Scrabble:
Logic of Scrabble game is implemented.

## design-pattern-one:
Triangle (right angle triangle) Design implemented.

## Ugly-number:
A number is considered to be ugly if its only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. 

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, â€¦] is the sequence of ugly numbers.

```
Hint:
An ugly number U can be expressed as: U = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, where a, b and c are non-negative integers.
```

## Deficient-number:
A number is considered deficient if the sum of its factors is less than twice that number.

```
For Example:
10 is a deficient number.
Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10
Sum is 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18 < 2 * 10
```

## Caesar Cipher:
Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted to a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it to communicate with his generals.

Here is a quick example of the encryption and decryption steps involved with the Caesar cipher. The text we will encrypt is "defend the east wall of the castle," with a shift (key) of 1.

```
Plaintext: "defend the east wall of the castle"
Ciphertext: "efgfoe uif fbtu xbmm pg uif dbtumf"
```

It is easy to see how each character in the plaintext is shifted up the alphabet. Decryption is just as easy, by using an offset of -1.

```
Another example:
Plaintext: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Ciphertext: "bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza"
The text above is shifted by 1 offset.
```

## Emrip-number:
An emirp is a prime number that results in a different prime when its decimal digits are reversed. For example, 13 is an emirp number because both 13 and 31 are prime numbers.

```
For example:
Input: 17

Output: true (17 and 71 are prime numbers)

Input: 113

Output: true (113 and 311 are prime numbers)

Input: 23

Output: false (23 is a prime number, but 32 is not)
```
## Disarium Number:

A number is called a Disarium number if the sum of the powers of its digits equals the number itself. The digits are powered to their positions in the number.

```
For example:
Input: 135
Output: true
135 is a Disarium number because it equals to 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 (each digit powered to the position in the number).
```

## Trimorphic Number
A trimorphic number is a number whose cube ends in the number itself. 

```
For example:
Input: 4
Output: true (4^3 is 64, which ends in 4)

Input: 24
Output: true (24^3 = 13824)

Input: 249
Output: true (249^3 = 15438249)
```

## Howling-prime
A howling prime is a prime number if the sum of its digits is also a prime number.

```
For Example:
Input:113
Output: true (113 is a prime number, 1+1+3=5 is also a prime number)

Input: 89
Output: true (89 is a prime number, 8+9=17 is also a prime number)

Input: 19 
Output: false (19 is a prime number, but 1+9=10 is not a prime number)
```

## Spy Number
A number is called a Spy number, if the sum and product of its digits are equal.
For example, 123 is a Spy number, as the sum of its digits is 6 (1+2+3) which is equal to the product of its digits: 6 (1x2x3).

```
For example:
Input: 1412
Output: true

Input: 247
Output: false
```

## Armstrong Number
An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For instance, a 3 digit number will be considered an Armstrong number if the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. 

```
For example, 153 is an Armstrong number, as 1**3 + 5**3 + 3**3 = 153
```

## Abundant Number 
If the sum of factors of a number is greater than twice that number, it is considered to be abundant.

```
For example:
12 is an abundant number.
Factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28 > 2 * 12
```
