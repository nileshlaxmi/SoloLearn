## This repository contains all challenges I have completed and submitted on SoloLearn.

### Below are challenges name:

## Spaces-from-String:
In this challenge, user can remove space between a sentence.

## Sort-a-String:
In this challenge, user can sort a string alphabetically and it also cater alphanumeric characters.

## Roman-Number-Converter:
In this challenge, user can enter decimal number which will convert to its respective Roman number.

## Scrabble:
Logic of Scrabble game is implemented.

## design-pattern-one:
Triangle (right angle triangle) Design implemented.

## Ugly-number:
Ugly Number Logic implemented.

## Deficient-number:
A number is considered deficient if the sum of its factors is less than twice that number.

```
For Example:
10 is a deficient number.
Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10
Sum is 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18 < 2 * 10
```

## Caesar Cipher:
Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted to a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who allegedly used it to communicate with his generals.

Here is a quick example of the encryption and decryption steps involved with the Caesar cipher. The text we will encrypt is "defend the east wall of the castle," with a shift (key) of 1.

```
Plaintext: "defend the east wall of the castle"
Ciphertext: "efgfoe uif fbtu xbmm pg uif dbtumf"
```

It is easy to see how each character in the plaintext is shifted up the alphabet. Decryption is just as easy, by using an offset of -1.

```
Another example:
Plaintext: "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Ciphertext: "bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza"
The text above is shifted by 1 offset.
```

## Emrip-number:
An emirp is a prime number that results in a different prime when its decimal digits are reversed. For example, 13 is an emirp number because both 13 and 31 are prime numbers.

```
For example:
Input: 17

Output: true (17 and 71 are prime numbers)

Input: 113

Output: true (113 and 311 are prime numbers)

Input: 23

Output: false (23 is a prime number, but 32 is not)
